# Object Recognition for Autonomous Vehicles
This repo goes along with the report listed here.

All code for training, and generating graphics used in the report is located in src.
transforms.py is used to train the transfer learning model, and the SSD model was trained i n CNN.py.
Note, even loading the graphics in demo.py takes significant time, as the testing data set is over 10,000 images. The data set is not included here due to its size, please see the documentation from Berkeley for bddk100k for downloading the data.
